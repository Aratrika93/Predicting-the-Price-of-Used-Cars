# Predicting-the-Price-of-Used-Cars
The task for this problem set was to identify the main factors, out of a pool of different factors,  responsible for the prices of used cars. 
We were also asked to propose a predictive model using  which we can determine the price of those cars. 
Additionally, an assessment was asked to make  regarding the impact the special modifications F1,F2,F3 &amp; F4 will have on the prices of the cars &amp;  
if at all those modifications should be included or not.
